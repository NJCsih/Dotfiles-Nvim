# Dotfiles-Nvim
My nvim dotfiles, keeping it simple.

Need to be converted to nix, or at least have nix handle installing the
dependency programs like TS/LSP stuff. I do like the idea of keeping my config
such that I can just drop it into any machine without having to install
nix(not-os) and maybe home-manager to do so.
